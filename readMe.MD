My mod was going to be some kind of might and magic close. With third person board army fighting.
But for now I only have 4/5 common deliverables done and still need a lot of work on the other ones.

How To Install:
CLone this repository
compile this file 
q4sdk.sln 

Bloops is the mod folder
Copy that into your game folder and run Quake 4
Then select bloops from the mod selection in Quake 4.
